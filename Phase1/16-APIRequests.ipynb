    "## The Many Use Cases For APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs can be used for many things - much more than just retrieving information. Twilio has an API that allows you to write a script to send text messages to people. GitHub has an API for creating new repositories. Many services have APIs allowing computers to automate tasks that a person might otherwise have to do through a website - whether uploading a photo to Flickr, searching for a company name in a state database, or getting a list of garbage collection times for a municipality."

    "## Limitations of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with APIs, there are some limitations you have to be aware of - especially relating to scope and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scope** - Just because a company has an API and has information, it doesn't mean you can get all of the information you might want through their API\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scale** - Some APIs are provided for free as a public service. Others you have to pay for, or allow you to perform activities (like sending a text message) that you pay for. Make sure that you know what the rate limits are and that your use case isn't going to need more API calls than you will be able to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "What else is good to know? **Every API is different!** There are some standards out there in terms of documentation and usage... but it's like the wild west - rapid expansion with few rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that out of the way - Let's take a look at the `requests` library and its uses."

to [KT-42297](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-42297).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Kotlin ObjC/Swift is pretty great, but at the moment there are also some gabs (especially with the Swift interop) like suspend functions and enum classes.\\\\r\\\\nWith some boilerplate code the interop for such code can be improved, which can even be automated with a compiler plugin/annotation processor.\\\\r\\\\nHowever one limitation of such boilerplate code is that it adds unnecessary declarations to your public API.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith the `ObjCRefined` and `SwiftRefined` annotations we can hide these unnecessary declarations from the public API.\\\\r\\\\nBoth annotations can be used as meta-annotations such that annotation processors can generate ObjC/Swift friendly APIs while automatically hiding the original declaration.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n### ObjCRefined\\\\r\\\\nFunctions and properties annotated with the `ObjCRefined` annotation won\\'t be exported to ObjC.\\\\r\\\\nThis allows you to create a more ObjC friendly version in your Kotlin.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n> With the `ObjCName` annotation from #4815 you could even use the original name of the function/property for your ObjC friendly version.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n### SwiftRefined\\\\r\\\\nThe `SwiftRefined` annotation adds the [`swift_private`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/objective-c_and_c_code_customization/improving_objective-c_api_declarations_for_swift) attribute to the declaration.\\\\r\\\\nThis results in the declarations being prefixed with `__`, which make them \\\\\"invisible\\\\\" from Swift.\\\\r\\\\nThese declarations can still be used in your Swift code to create your Swift friendly API, but won\\'t be shown in e.g. the Xcode autocomplete.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n### ToDos\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- [ ] Add tests\\\\r\\\\n- [ ] Add

Why they need to be `ctrl M`'s I don't know, but if they are converted to unix line endings, the patch fails. I'll revert them back on both the RC and develop.\",\n",
